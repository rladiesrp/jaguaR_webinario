The land cover data set from Taiamã was obtained from the map extracted from 
the "MapBiomas Project - Collection 4.1 of the Annual Series of Coverage and 
Land Use Maps in Brazil, accessed on 06/07/20 through the 
link: https://mapbiomas.org/”. This project is a multi-institutional initiative 
to generate annual maps of land cover and use from automatic classification 
processes applied to images of satellite. 


The shapefile was used to extract the classification soil cover data using the 
R routine. The data set was stored in tables: 
- classif_cobertura_solo
- TB_RST_MovAnimal_Estado_CopiA
